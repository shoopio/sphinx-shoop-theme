Using the Shuup Admin
=====================

Navigating the Admin Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Shuup Admin menu contains a list of categories. Each category can
contain one or more links to admin pages for specific sections.

If there is only one option for a category, clicking the category name
will automatically open that page. If there are multiple options,
clicking the name will expand the category to show all options.

Sorting and Filtering Tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Different pages in the Shuup Admin may contain a table of different
items (such as customers, orders, or products). Rows within this table
may be sortable or filterable, depending on the section.

If a column is sortable, you will be able to change the sorting behavior
(unsorted, alphabetical, or reverse alphabetical) by clicking the name
of the column.

If a column is filterable, a text box or other filter fields will be
available to adjust the filters. Rows that do not match the filter will
not be displayed.
